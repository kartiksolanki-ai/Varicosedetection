# Varicosedetection
The project aimed to develop an AI-based solution for predicting the presence of varicose veins using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The goal was to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis, reducing the need for invasive procedures and speeding up the screening process.
